# Pantograph Project
This project implements a mechanical pantograph that is controlled using two servo motors driven by an Arduino. The system consists of two arms forming a parallelogram linkage. By applying inverse kinematics, the servo motors calculate and adjust their angles to move a pen along a 2D plane to draw shapes like lines, arcs, and circles.

## Components Required
- 2x Servo Motors
- 4x Ice-cream sticks (used as arms)
- 1x Pen or pencil lead
- 1x Base (a ruler or any sturdy platform)
- Arduino Nano (or any compatible microcontroller)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for easy connections)

## Working of Pantograph
- Each servo controls one arm of the pantograph.
- The system uses inverse kinematics to calculate the required angles between each arm and the X-axis (or vertical axis) based on the desired end-effector (pen) position.
- The code includes functions for:
    - Moving to a specific point
    - Drawing a straight line
    - Drawing an arc
    - Drawing a circle
- These motions are generated by updating the angles of the servos in real-time based on calculated positions.

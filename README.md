# Pantograph-Project

This is a pantograph mechanis, which is controlled by using two servo motors via a arduino-code. It has two arms, each of them being controlled by a servo motor which uses inverse kinematics in order to calculate the point needed to move in the 2d plane.

## Components Required:
- Two Servo Motors
- 4 Ice-cream stick(for arms)
- A pen lead
- A base to hold the structure(can use a ruler)
- Arduino Nano(or any other microcontroller of your choice)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard(optional)

## Working of the Pantograph
- What we have essentially done is that, each motor will control on of the arm and for each  of them we have calculated the
